## README

# BUILD
sudo docker build . --build-arg ARCH=`arch` -t project_`arch`

# RUN
sudo docker run project_`arch`

# TODO
- Makefile from .tpd
- build time make (because we may want to run many HC (Host Controller service))
- external CMD (may you don't want to run test when container starting)
- generate COMPOSING-FILE from a .cfg file (because we want to config only one place)
